Problem Statement:

    Vulnerability Identification:
    Low code/no code applications often lack the rigorous code reviews and testing procedures that traditional applications undergo. As a result, vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure data storage can easily go unnoticed. The problem is how to identify and address these vulnerabilities effectively within the low code/no code development paradigm.

    Data Security and Privacy:
    With low code/no code platforms, users can quickly create applications that handle sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data. Ensuring proper encryption, access control, and compliance with data protection regulations becomes a challenge. How can data security and privacy be maintained in an environment where non-technical users design applications?

    Integration with Third-party Services:
    Many low code/no code applications rely on third-party APIs and services for various functionalities. Integrating these services introduces security risks, such as authentication issues and data leakage. How can low code/no code developers securely integrate external services without compromising the application's security?

    Access Control and Authentication:
    Implementing robust access control and authentication mechanisms is crucial for protecting applications. However, non-technical users might struggle to set up and configure these security features correctly. How can low code/no code platforms provide easy-to-use yet secure access control and authentication options?

    Lack of Code Visibility:
    Traditional developers can review code for security flaws, but in low code/no code environments, the underlying code is often abstracted or hidden. This lack of code visibility makes it challenging to assess and mitigate security risks effectively. How can we enhance security without direct code access?

    Security Testing Tools:
    The security testing tools and practices that work for traditional coding environments may not be suitable for low code/no code applications. There is a need for specialized tools and methodologies that cater to the unique characteristics of these platforms. How can we develop effective security testing tools for low code/no code development?

    Secure Deployment:
    Deploying low code/no code applications in production environments requires careful consideration of security. Without proper guidance, developers may expose vulnerabilities during the deployment process. How can we ensure that deployment practices for low code/no code applications are secure by default?

    Training and Awareness:
    Security best practices may be unfamiliar to non-technical users who leverage low code/no code platforms. Providing training and raising awareness about security issues is essential. How can we educate and empower users to make security-conscious decisions in their application development process?
